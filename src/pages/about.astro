					<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					<p>
						PWKeep was created with a simple but important mission: provide a secure, privacy-focused
						password manager that puts users in complete control of their data. In an age where data
						breaches and privacy violations are commonplace, we believe your passwords should never
						leave your device.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="about-section">
					<h2>Why PWKeep?</h2>
					<p>
						Unlike other password managers that store your data in the cloud, PWKeep keeps everything
						local on your device. This approach offers several key advantages:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Complete Privacy:</strong> Your data never leaves your device</li>
						<li><strong>No Monthly Fees:</strong> Free forever, no subscriptions required</li>
						<li><strong>Faster Access:</strong> No network delays when accessing your passwords</li>
						<li><strong>Zero Breach Risk:</strong> Can't be hacked if it's not online</li>
						<li><strong>Full Control:</strong> You own your data completely</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="about-section">
					<h2>Security First</h2>
					<p>
						PWKeep uses industry-standard security practices to protect your data:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>AES-256-GCM Encryption:</strong> Military-grade encryption for all sensitive data</li>
						<li><strong>PBKDF2 Key Derivation:</strong> 100,000 iterations make brute force attacks impossible</li>
						<li><strong>Secure Random Generation:</strong> Cryptographically secure password generation</li>
						<li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Architecture:</strong> Even we can't see your passwords</li>
						<li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Transparent code that security experts can review</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="about-section">
					<h2>Cross-Platform Support</h2>
					<p>
						PWKeep works seamlessly across all major browsers and platforms:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Chrome and Chromium-based browsers</li>
						<li>Firefox</li>
						<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
						<li>Safari (with manual installation)</li>
						<li>Opera</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="about-section">
					<h2>Open Source & Free</h2>
					<p>
						PWKeep is completely open source and free to use. We believe security tools should be
						transparent and accessible to everyone. You can review our code, contribute improvements,
						or even build your own version.
