					<h2>Our Mission</h2>
					<p>
						PWKeep was created with a simple but important mission: provide a secure, privacy-focused
						password manager that puts users in complete control of their data. We believe in a
						local-first approach with optional premium sync for those who need multi-device access.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="about-section">
					<h2>Why PWKeep?</h2>
					<p>
						PWKeep takes a local-first approach to password management, keeping your data secure
						on your device by default. This approach offers several key advantages:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Privacy by Default:</strong> Your data stays local unless you choose to sync</li>
						<li><strong>Free Core Features:</strong> Full password manager functionality at no cost</li>
						<li><strong>Fast Access:</strong> No network delays when accessing your passwords</li>
						<li><strong>Optional Sync:</strong> Premium sync available when you need multi-device access</li>
						<li><strong>Full Control:</strong> You decide where your data lives</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="about-section">
					<h2>Security First</h2>
					<p>
						PWKeep uses industry-standard security practices to protect your data:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>AES-256-GCM Encryption:</strong> Military-grade encryption for all sensitive data</li>
						<li><strong>PBKDF2 Key Derivation:</strong> 100,000 iterations make brute force attacks impossible</li>
						<li><strong>Secure Random Generation:</strong> Cryptographically secure password generation</li>
						<li><strong>Zero-Knowledge Architecture:</strong> Even we can't see your passwords</li>
						<li><strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> Premium sync uses client-side encryption</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="about-section">
